## How to build contracts

Currently `partisia-contract` sdk doesn't support Rust Workspaces.
So to build contracts from this repo on your own you will need to:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a new contract outside this folder
3. Import {contract}-base package from `packages/` folder.
4. Copy all the files from selected contract, for example from `contracts/mpc20`
5. Run `cargo partisia-contract build --release` command.

Or you can download pre-compiled artifacts from [`here`](https://github.com/partisiablockchainapplications/CoreContracts/releases)
